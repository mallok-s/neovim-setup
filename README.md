# neovim-setup
My veovim setup. Currently orientated to Python development with a little Go.
Please note the script assumes you're fedora (just change the commands to the correct 
package manager. Unless it's windows, in which case can I interest you in a sensible 
development environment?). 

Just run setup.sh to install and configure neovim.

Note the script is based off this tutorial:
